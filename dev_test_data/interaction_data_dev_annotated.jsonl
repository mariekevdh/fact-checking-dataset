The correlation to Hitler's use of the sentiment is uncorroborated and seemed to be referenced solely as a political motivation. In other words, he \"invoked Hitler\".When Episode III hit the streets some reviewers made the same correlation you do regarding Skywalker's use. Some have said that Lucas was making a rare political statement and making a jab at the President with a direct paraphrase and then following it with the benevolent character saying, \"Only the Sith think in such absolute terms.\", or something along that line. As a Lucas and Star Wars fan, I hope that Lucas wasn't selling out his professional legacy by inserting commentary about contemporary politics. I think it is ironic that the entire series is specifically and in absolute terms about diametrically opposing Good versus Evil. The character who says the \"only the Sith think in such terms\" line has spent his life developing skills to take advantage of light side of the Force while avoiding the \"Dark Side\" of the Force. The Star Wars saga is all about being with one side and against the other, and yet all of a sudden one of the preeminent characters is a \"Moderate\" Jedi promoting the gray area between the light and Dark Side.I too would like to see other historic uses of the sentiment.

The Sun, by itself, isn't necessarily the best source, however I have seen the report on several other shows such as eTalk Daily and at least one local news show but I wasn't paying attention which broadcaster it was. The Sun link isn't great because to read the whole story one needs to subscribe -- can anyone find a better link that either offers the complete Sun story or, perhaps, provides a corroborating report? The fact the rumor has been reported worldwide makes it notable enough to be included here. IMO Jolie would be a great choice for the role to make up for Craig's relative lack of street cred in the US, but this could end up being just another rumor such as the DAD rumor about Connery filming a cameo that was also reported on TV and elsewhere. I've also seen a single online-based news report suggesting Jessica Alba is also a contender, but I haven't included it in the article as I've yet to see this rumor mentioned anywhere else.","TIMESTAMP":"14:23, 19 October 2005 (UTC)","USER":"23skidoo"},{"COMMENT-ID":"6924529-1-1","COMMENT-NR":1,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":Jolie would overshadow Bond and that's not good.

The only reason I listed Jolie is because there's been fairly widespread coverage of her (and to be honest if we didn't recognize it as a rumor pretty soon someone would post that it's fact). Personally I think it'll be a British actress since we've already had two Bond films in a row with American leading ladies (Denise Richards and Halle Berry), plus Jolie just did a very similar part in Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I agree that casting Jolie might overshadow the film, though I don't think Diana Rigg really overshadowed OHMSS that much since most of the ads I've seen for it in Cork's book and elsewhere show the promotion focused on the new Bond. As one who hated Berry's performance in DAD with a passion I don't know if the series needs to have a Bond girl with equal billing. I think a lot will depend upon MGM\/Sony's attitude. If the reports are true that they wanted Brosnan one more time it's just possible that they caved in to the request for a relatively unknown (in America) Bond, perhaps with the understanding that a \"name\" actor will pick things up either as Vesper or LeChiffre, or maybe in a supporting role such as Michael Madsen appearing in DAD. In any event, the film will not live or die based upon the Bond girl (again look at DAD, AVTAK, MWTGG and other entries with IMO poor lead Bond girls), it'll live or die based upon who plays Bond and that hurdle has been jumped, for better or for worse.","TIMESTAMP":"19:14, 19 October 2005 (UTC)","USER":"23skidoo"},{"COMMENT-ID":"6924529-1-3","COMMENT-NR":3,"LEVEL":3,"TEXT-CLEAN":":::Rigg was specifically hired to offset Lazenby being a relative-unknown an inexperienced actor.

Mr. Snow contacted Mr. Mafera and in cooperation, using a heavier guage wire, built a chain link fence for the Cambridge Schools.The fencing system was incorporated into the products of the American Spring Bed Manufacturing Company and eventually became so viable that the company changed it's name to the American Chain Link Fence Company in the early 1920's.

I do not currently have the Nielson and Skousen article cited, but from reviews in other publications, I find it as saying that 84% of the KJV New Testament text derives ultimately from Tyndale, 5% from the Geneva Bible, 3% original to King James translators, and 2% each from Coverdale, the Great Bible, the Bishops' Bible and Rheims. But these percentages are not exclusive; the bulk of the Tyndale 84% will also be in Rheims (and Geneva and the Bishops'). Nielson and Skousen took a sample of KJV texts, and sought to track the earliest occurrence of each word or phrase to its origin in a previous version. But we know that the King James translators didn't start with the earliest English versions and work forwards, they started with the most recent versions - Rheims, the Bishops' and Geneva - and then worked backwards. Ward Allen states: \"The [KJV]translators, for example, in revising the text of the synoptic Gospels in the Bishops' Bible, owe about one-fourth of their revisions, each, to the Geneva and Rheims New Testaments. Another fourth of their work can be traced to the work of Tyndale and Coverdale. And the final fourth of their revisions is original to the translators themselves\". The Rheims New Testament is derived largely from Coverdale's 1538 edition, which itself was a reworking of Tyndale with his objectional non-ecclesiastical terms taken out. So the overwhelming bulk of Rheims is Coverdale, which is also Tyndale; and in so far as the KJV translators may be found to have adopted Tyndale's phrasing, they are more likely to have taken it from editions of Rheims, Geneva or the Bishops' - which we know they had open in front of them - rather than directly from Tyndale.

In short, it had a bigger vocabulary. Some editions of the D-R included a \"dictionary\", as an appendix, to explain some words.

The preface to the 1611 addresses this issue: \"we have shunned the obscurity of the Papists, in their AZIMES, TUNIKE, RATIONAL, HOLOCAUSTS, PR\u00c6PUCE, PASCHE, and a number of such like, whereof their late Translation is full, and that of purpose to darken the sense, that since they must needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept from being understood. But we desire that the Scripture may speak like itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of the very vulgar\". This implies that the D-R had a major influence on the KJV, but not in the way we would expect to regard \"influence\". As an aside: AZIMES= Jewish term for unleavened bread; TUNIKE= tunic (clothing, dress); RATIONAL= ceremonial robe worn by OT priest, also a vestment worn by R Catholic priests; The KJV says \"breastplate\", however it was not an item of armour. HOLOCAUSTS= burnt offering; PR\u00c6PUCE: medical term for foreskin; PASCHE= passover, in Acts 12:4 where KJV says Easter","TIMESTAMP":"03:59, 2 June 2015 (UTC)","USER":"Lugnad"},{"COMMENT-ID":"558083-18-3","COMMENT-NR":3,"LEVEL":4,"TEXT-CLEAN":"::::True to a point Lugard. The Rheims New Testament does indeed choose Latinisms and transliterated Greek\/Hebrew in preference for common English terms in rendering 'religious' and 'ecclesiastical' terminology. And the KJV translators filched a lot of these, especially for their marginal readings (the KJV preface is not to be taken at face value here). But otherwise Rheims uses a vocabulary that is much closer to everyday terminology. By contrast, the Bishop's bible had tended to adopt a more dignified vocabulary, as more suited for public reading in church (the Rheims version of course not being intended for public reading). Hence at Luke 22:56, the servant girl is termed a 'wenche' in Tyndale; but this is reworded by both the Bishops' and Geneva to 'maid'. Rheims keeps Tyndale's 'wenche'; the KJV sticks with 'maid'. Mostly the KJV retains the Bishops' aim for dignified language; but sometimes does go back from the Bishop's more pompous terminology to amore colloquial form from Tyndale; but in this it is commonly following Tyndale as found in Rheims, rather than the original Tyndale text (which was not readily accessible in the early 17th Century).

(please, can't this be piped away somewhere?

The protectors of this page won't allow anything that suggests he is perfectly moral and making unquestionable decisions. I feel that they don't understand the moral and philosophical complexities of comic book characters. They wouldn't even let me mention that some of the villians in his universe are morally ambiguous -- Catwoman, for example, even became a \"superhero\". Poison Ivy accuses Wayne Enterprises of being environmentally unsound. When Lex Luthor controls the media and acts as an arms dealer he is a villain, when Wayne does it he is a hero. The Joker is crazy, Batman is sane. There is no gray area in any of this as far as the fans who police this page are concerned. Batman is the best. Their hero.

Everyone \"knows\" that Batman is supposed to be good, he fights bad guys and what not, but it doesn't seem to me that many are actually excercising critical thought and questioning what the character does in the comic books. He is a weapons manufacturer and arms dealer, he owns toxic corporations such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants (which have been ethically challenged by his foes, namely Poison Ivy), he runs the biggest newspaper and other media to put a positive spin on his actions. And when Lex Luthor does these things they are called into question. He is a vigilante around whom others have died. Many of the villains in Batman were created due to their connection with Wayne Enterprises. Etc. At least some of those items listed above should be seen as morally dubious (at best) if not outright villainous. I mean, if you can mention that Tony Stark is an arms dealer and an alcoholic (and that he may have came down on the authoritarian side of Marvel's Civil War series), then why is Batman\/BruceWayne beyond reproach? I mean are you seriously suggesting that he is beyond reproach completely and doesn't have any personality flaws?

In how many versions of Batman's history is he taken to task by Poison Ivy for pollution (It certainly wasn't that way in the 1960s). Moreover, is Bruce Wayne intentionally polluting in the first place? Since when does he run \"the biggest newspaper and other media to put a positive spin on his actions\"? I don't remember ever reading that.

This is patently far too reductive, and does not include cites either. The snow lion translation of Tsongkhapa's LamRim Chenmo has two chapters devoted to the discussion of the Prasanga\/Svatantrika distinction, including a reasonably comprehensive peer review of Tsonkhapa's contemporaries. In Elizabeth Napper's \"Dependant Arising and Emptiness\", she has devoted an updated and likewise comprehensive review of modern era (mainly Western) scholars' interpretations of the Prasangika\/Svatantrika distinction. In brief, and as I understand it, Tsongkhapa asserts that the Prasangika rejects any notion of an autonomous argument. What this means is that Prasangikas reject the notion that for an argument to be efficacious, it's subject must be established as appearing in common by both parties. (LRCM, p254). More to the point is the assertion that the Svatantrika's believe that essences have conventional existence, whereas Prasangikas reject that essences exist even conventionally (LRCM p255). Of course, all these terms have a very technical meaning, and need to be read in context.

I wasn't initially clear that you were using the term 'self', as a part of the self\/phenomena duplet, rather than referring to self as essence (what all phenomena are empty of). The self is an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is selflessness. (Bodhisattvayogacary\u0101catu\u1e25\u015bataka\u1e6dik\u0101 256.1.7). Also, thanks for highlighting Napper's text (p65 above) - I think we would need to be careful with that - out of context she could be read to be asserting that as a phenomena, emptiness has a distinct mode of existence to everything else, which is just not the case. Your point made above is also fascinating - but I'm not sure that I agree. My understanding (and I may be wrong!) of the primary purpose of distinguishing between self\/phenomena was that it is the grasping of the self that is what keeps us locked into Samsara, and not that it is necessarily the emptiness of self which is realised first (for instance we often start off examining a chariot!). I am aware that colleges\/schools may differ on this - my learning most closely follows Loseling- so there may be a difference of nuance there. Personally, I think it would be better not to get into an intercollegiate\/interschool debate on a general article regarding the Prasangika\/Svanatrika distinction, which may mean that we possibly cannot assert the self\/phenomena argument that you propose here as a general interpretation of that distinction.

What we don't want to do is follow the media, whose perspective can be skewed by personal ignorance (in the sense of simply lacking the specific knowledge to fully understand well enough what they are writing about, and not meaning to imply a lack of innate intelligence), drinking the Kool-Aid of the press releases, getting starry-eyed for the major universities and their expensive publicists, and slow news days. Nature wrote a commentary about how the PNAS paper was DOA because the authors didn't take advantage of the growing trend of pre-release that would have shown them where they were going to come up short, and that gives us a better indication of its true weight as an individual study (as opposed to the general concept) than the press coverage. I think that relegates it to being used as a cited example of the substructure alternative and not highlighted as a noteworthy study in its own right. (And you are right about the species\/subspecies issue: the species concept itself is too fuzzy for any conclusion that isn't begged by the question - people will decide which they want it to be and choose their criteria to defend that decision. Now that we know the degree to which trans-species introgression takes place, the least fuzzy criterion we had, of normal reproductive isolation, is no more hard-and-fast than any of the others so it comes down unavoidably to personal and somewhat arbitrary conclusions.)","TIMESTAMP":"04:14, 17 September 2013 (UTC)","USER":"Agricolae"}],"LABEL":"yes"}

The article attributes this to jewelers seeing an opportunity to sell more rings, but I think a more important reason, or at least a more important consequence, is the growing belief in equality between the sexes in marriage. The pre-feminist perspective was, crudely speaking, that married women needed to be designated as belonging to their husbands, by wearing a wedding ring and being called Mrs. Richard Roe instead of Miss Jane Doe; whereas married men neither needed nor wanted any such indicators of their married status. Now that most married men wear wedding rings, it is harder for men to conceal their married status, and it is considered somewhat dishonorable for them to expect to. The cultural change is evident in the facetious Air Force slogan \"wheels up -- rings off,\" which expresses a foot-dragging accommodation to the new attitudes: once the airplane had taken off, the men on board would supposedly remove their wedding rings and pretend to be single. If they still thought like typical 19th century men, they would not have consented to wear wedding rings in the first place, nor felt guilty about their away-from-home infidelities.","TIMESTAMP":"21:45, 28 September 2010 (UTC)","USER":"CharlesHBennett"},{"COMMENT-ID":"48364903-16-1","COMMENT-NR":1,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":citation?

I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a GA. However, in reviewing the article, I have found there are several issues that need to be addressed.#There are a few dead links that should be fixed. The Internet Archive may be able to help.#There are a few dabs that should be fixed.#Although it is not required by GA criteria (so it will not be a requirement for the review), it would be beneficial to add alt text to the images. See WP:ALT for assistance.#The article makes use of three non-free images, and I think only one or two of them are necessary for the article. I'd recommend dropping :File:Lennon Stanley Parkes.jpg since it does not cover the subject. For the other two images of Smith, perhaps choose one for the infobox and drop the other. I'm not going to be too picky since this is only GA, but I don't think that the images' use can be justified if the article heads up to FAC at some point.#I have tagged :File:Mimi Smith and John Lennon.JPG to be reduced in size. Although not a requirement for this review, it would be beneficial to reduce the non-free image's size.#The lead needs to be expanded to better summarize the article. See WP:LEAD for guidelines.#Throughout the article there are several one or two-sentence paragraphs. Either expand on these or incorporate them into another paragraph.#\"According to Lennon, the Stanley family once owned the whole of Woolton village.\" It may be best to start off this section with a different sentence, as well as clarify where Woolton village is for readers who may be unaware.#\"Despite this, Mimi wore sensible dresses, and always looked as if she was on her way to a weekly garden club meeting.\" This sounds like a quote, if it is, add quotation marks and indicate who said it. Otherwise, it would best to reword the statement.#\"Mimi and \"John\"\" Is there are a reason John is in quotation marks? In addition, the subsection within it should be renamed as it is similar to this title.#\"Mimi phoned the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital that evening and was told that Julia had given birth to a boy\" Although it may be obvious to many, it would be beneficial to mention John's name here as some readers may skip the lead and jump straight to this section.#\"He called her one night from New York asking her to check behind the bush for a surprise...The bush had to be cut down as it was overgrown and there stuck to wall was the plaque saying\" Music's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it\".\" The ellipses is not necessary. The spacing should also be fixed for the initial quotation mark.#The subsections within \"Lennon's girlfriends and wives\" don't need to include her name again, just list the names.
