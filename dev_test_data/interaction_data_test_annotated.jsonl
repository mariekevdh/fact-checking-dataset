While Christianity as it developed in the early centuries, certainly had some negative views towards Jews, the gnostic movement which was flourishing at just the same time as early Christianity was developing, had a much richer source of descriptions of Jews as being evil. While early Christianity, when it finally consolidated, agreed to accept the Hebrew Bible into its canon (the \"Old Testament\"), the gnostic Christians who were around at the same time, opposed this, on the grounds that the God of the Jews, the God of the Hebrew Bible, was the Devil, the evil god that created sin and the material world. It's all the more unusual that no one mentions this in the articles on anti-semitism, when much of the material that the article references (the Nazi material, for example), is claiming that Jews are satanic and evil. Do people not see the possible historical influence that these early gnostic ideas may have had on the later history of anti-semitism in Christian countries? And it is also true that these gnostic ideas did not die out, that they continued to influence Christian countries through the centuries. (There are many works outlining the history and spread of gnosticism - see \"Hans Jonas: the Gnostic Religion\", for example).* Wasn't there a relationship between the Nazi desire to defeat the Soviet\/Communist \"threat\", and the destruction of the Jews? Didn't the Nazis (and the members of the Anti-Comintern Pact)see the Jews as being potential allies of communism, and for that reason they were an internal threat that could easily be destroyed, as part of the Nazi's greater war against the Soviet Union? In other words, the \"Jewish Communist\" was a cause of anti-semitism, similar to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, \"Jewish Communists\" executed in the United States in 1953 (only 8 years after the Nazis were defeated).* Does no one see the obvious relationship between the over 10 million speakers of Yiddish in Europe, and the anti-semitism which was spearheaded by none other people than German speakers (Austria and Germany)? German anti-semitism can certainly be explained in a large part by the German speaker's perceived threat of a huge ocean of non-Christian, non-European Jews, speaking what would to the German ear be a bizzare, incomprehensible dialect of German, and written, moreover, not in European, Latin letters, from left to right, but instead in Hebrew letters, from right to left. People also often forget today, how widespread Yiddish educational instutitions and the Yiddish press were in Europe before the Nazis took power. It is nearly impossible for someone living in the U.S. today to imagine the situation that existed between the German speakers and the Yiddish speakers in Germany - and this relationship is clearly a factor that influenced German anti-semitism.* What about the obvious fact that Judaism preceded Christianity and Islam, and Christianity and Islam claim to replace Judaism? Since Jews just weren't up to being replaced, this resulted in Christian\/Islamic persecutions of them, as they stuck out like a sore thumb in Christianity\/Islam that the Jews and Judaism really hadn't been replaced by the newer religions? This is further backed up by the noticable fact that ancient religions existing today that *did not* claim to replace Judaism, are not fundamentally anti-semitic at all.* These things listed above are all almost completely obvious possible root causes of anti-semitism, and there should be a subsection of this article that discusses root causes such as these.","TIMESTAMP":"13:02, 21 December 2006 (UTC)","USER":"Jimhoward72"},{"COMMENT-ID":"9336472-34-1","COMMENT-NR":1,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":See WP:NOR, and WP:Verifiability, thanks,","TIMESTAMP":"14:15, 21 December 2006 (UTC)","USER":"Slrubenstein"},{"COMMENT-ID":"9336472-34-2","COMMENT-NR":2,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":Sounds like an interesting thesis to relate the gnostic idea of the demiurge to anti-Judaism, but I don't know what you could get out of original sources.

Therefore you may move the sub-section to below the constutional revolution. I also placed it under 20th century, therefore it doesn't matter if this was in the Pahlavi era becouse it is still 20th century. If this is not about history the article should not feature the persecution of Azeris in the Pahlavi era, for this is hisotry also. The establishment of an Azeri state in what is Northern Iran is a very big historical marker and one so recent no matter what.It is also supported by many sources which discuss Modern Iran, therefore should be placed in. The term Azeri Turks will not result in ambiquity in the English langauge for it says \"Turks\" not \"Turkish\" this, is you own POV. There are also many sources that support this, more than Persian Azeris and these are from well known western professors: In the introduction it reads Iranian Azeris, Persian Azeris.

Because Dr. Thaler's technology puts theory into practice, it can stand on its own, and in the end, actions always speak louder than words. Many also seem to forget that just because Dr. Thaler is not active in a university (where you are not as independent to pursue your own projects), he nevertheless remains a very well-credentialed scientist that could easily fulfill an academic position if he wanted to. If there are no serious attempts by researchers to contact him in order to assess this technology in an academic environment, then I am afraid this falls into the category of pseudo-skepticism and should be acknowledged as such. If there is ego-investment involved, which does not allow for the realization that you are pursuing a fruitless path, gaining a voice in the establishment can be a struggle for any competitors or even colleagues. After reading Prof. Schmidhuber's \"Formal Theory\", it does seem like a watered-down version of Dr. Thaler's theory, lacking neuro-biological details. As it was stated before, we can have the most abstract theories floating around in the air, but without a material foundation and straight-forward science, they remain just that. I personally would rather trust Dr. Thaler's long-standing expertise and experience in this matter, simply because he developed the sought-after recursively self-improving AI, which in itself is worthy of a Nobel Prize. On top of that he can prove it experimentally. I regard him as the foremost authority on neural-based AI, the saving grace in an intellectually stagnating field. This statement may sound totally overblown, but is not without merit. An elegant theory, based on the actual human brain, with so much predictive power is the hallmark of science. Just observe what capabilities are hailed in popular circles and then ask yourself: Can Dr. Thaler's networks do this?

I have, however, carefully read everything about his work that I could possibly find which forced me to conclude that this is unlike any other AI principle currently on the market. The reason why it is regarded as no big deal is because of several factors. One of them is that people don't know that the standard \"Creativity Machine\" model of two interlinked networks is not the whole story. He actually builds, or more accurately lets them build themselves, very large cascades without algorithmic programming(!) based on his second patent (5,845,271). To my knowledge, self-forming cascades based on self-training ANN elements are unprecedented. Another reason why it is so easily dismissed is that \"randomness\" gets a bad rap in general, when it is a key ingredient for brain activity. It is simply impossible to have genuine AI without random idea generation or imagination. Neural networks mirror the external world and these perturbations (via an adjustable Cavitation Rate) are softening the relationships of the information they absorbed resulting not in random nonsense, like it is often thought, but in new plausible information(!). This new information is then judged by other networks for usefulness, and if it is not useful, the perturbations become more severe and the machine relentlessly tries out every single conceivable possibility until a solution is found. Useless neurons also get eliminated in this process, which is completely automatic, and new STANN-Objects are produced as they are needed. No genetic algorithms whatsoever are involved here, neither is simple back-propagation. You really have to wrap your mind around this to grasp the magnitude of it. Dr. Thaler is just way ahead of the curve waiting for academic inertia to catch up. Neurobiology also shows parallels to this invention. For example, Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder (OCD) research clearly proves that some areas of the brain generate ideas which other areas act upon. It is also known that stronger perturbations (like the ones induced by drugs) cause stronger hallucinations. It is just unfortunate that Dr. Thaler's work does not enjoy the same recognition as it does in the government, which gladly uses this technology for secret projects. While I think that the article is slightly biased and maybe should be reduced to the basic \"Creativity Machine\" diagram, Dr. Thaler deserves the same fair hearing as any other scientist. If he is correct an his machines can solve all kinds of problems, then we can objectively test them out and see how they hold up to public scrutiny. That he is not frequently referenced does not discredit his accomplishments. I have found experimental support as well as a critique of his concept. For confirmation search for \"A Modular Neurocontroller for Creative Mobile Autonomous Robots Learning by Temporal Difference\" by Helmut A. Mayer from the Department of Scientific Computing of the University of Salzburg, Austria.

The primary meaning of the adjective qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in all of these French phrases is \"relative to Quebec\". However, by translating the French word as Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, you are translating a word whose primary (or perhaps sole) meaning in French is non-ethnic by one in English which is. Translating nationalisme qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois or identit\u00e9 qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise with the English word Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which has an ethnic meaning connotation, tends to discredit Quebec nationalists and people who identify in French as Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois by insinuating that they are using this term ethnically. As for \"culture qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise\", any identification of Quebec with its ethnic or linguistic majority when the word is used this way does not go beyond what you ordinarily do when you say \"Swedish cuisine\" and think of meatballs rather than the cuisine of the Muslim minority there. The phrases \"American literature\" and \"American culture\" call to mind literature in English and the culture of the English-language majority, and yet that does not mean that Hispanics in the United States are not American. \"Quebec culture\" can be used in the same way, but if the culture of francophone Quebecers is meant a more neutral term than Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois can be used.","TIMESTAMP":"10:52, 23 April 2007 (UTC)","USER":"Joeldl"},{"COMMENT-ID":"102252-12-1","COMMENT-NR":1,"LEVEL":0,"TEXT-CLEAN":"No There is more than enough empirical evidence that Quebec is being constructed as a nation inclusive of all its citizens.

In addition, the Charter of the French language defined the language rights common to all Quebecers and specific rights to minorities.

An endless series of examples could be provided with enough people giving the time to the task. Yet the attacks on Quebec nationalism are routine in the corporate media close to political parties that have sworn to fend it off. But beyond those using sophistry to persuade because they have no real arguments to convince, there are intelligent people legitimately asking: \"If Canada is already an inclusive society respectful of its minorities, then what are Quebec nationalists after?\".

While academics would seldom use the N-word, its use in informal situations can ultimately be considered a manifestation of POV. Academics might manifest POV through their language in less extreme ways, but Wikipedia must exercise caution not to reproduce it. To take an example, there are complex considerations relating to the word \"queer\" in English, and some gay people may now view the word in a positive light. For that reason, it may find its way into some scholarship. But that does not mean a Wikipedia editor can write that \"relations between the queer and straight communities have improved.\" Even if a word is attested to some degree, Wikipedia must still exercise a certain level of discernment that stops short of incorporating into its own language anything that can be found in academic writing anywhere, and must exercise a degree of judgment on its own. Our personal stances do count because there may be no objective way of determining to what extent the use of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois by some authors is a manifestation of POV, or even lack of familiarity with the connotations of the word Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois on the part of non-Canadians, that should be discounted. Wikipedia's model is the most neutral form of academic writing, but some judgment must be exercised as to what this is. Furthermore, there is the fact that Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois identity and \"Quebec identity\" likely refer to the same objective reality (since there is no linguistic distinction possible in French, the language in which most Quebecers express their identity) but differ only by the writer's attitude towards it.","TIMESTAMP":"11:25, 24 April 2007 (UTC)","USER":"Joeldl"},{"COMMENT-ID":"102252-12-5","COMMENT-NR":5,"LEVEL":0,"TEXT-CLEAN":"Comparison to 'N' word inapproriate.

WP:WEIGHT clearly does not state that Wikipedia simply aims to present competing views in proportion to their representation in reliable sources on the subject. In fact, as I've repeatedly stated, WP:WEIGHT is more complicated than that. Please read the following from WP:WEIGHT: \"Undue weight applies to more than just viewpoints. An article should not give undue weight to any aspects of the subject but should strive to treat each aspect with a weight appropriate to its significance to the subject. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and neutral, but still be disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news. Note that undue weight can be given in several ways, including, but not limited to, depth of detail, quantity of text, prominence of placement, and juxtaposition of statements.\" In that light, the article should generally be discussing the militant aspect with more details than, say, the welfare aspect, but not because there are fewer reliable sources (Western or not) for the non-militant aspects of Hamas. The militant aspects are simply considered of somewhat more importance to most international (worldwide perspective) readers. But that does not mean -- please read preceding WP:WEIGHT quote if you haven't already -- that we should give the negative aspects of Hamas ten times as much coverage as its non-negative aspects.

Not only is it confusing to say that a dwarf planet is not a planet, but the name could make astronomers a laughing stock. Every smart ass kid in the classroom is going to say: 'Sir\/Miss, dwarf planets, is that where dwarfs come from?' and all the kids will fall around laughing. Snow White and the seven Plutonians anyone? Somebody call Peter Jackson, his casting problems for The Hobbit (if it's ever made)are over - all he has to do is go to Pluto haha. It might well be a public relations disaster that would hold astronomers up to ridicule.All joking aside, it is understandable that scientists like to have precedents for when they coin new terminology but 'dwarf planet' is not the answer. With all the talk of densities of rock and ice etc, the debate moved into the realms of geology and that is where the real precedents lie. Many terms in geology use the suffix 'ule' from Latin and Greek as a dimunitive. Here are some example- note that they have the relevant quality of roundness:*Globe - globule;*Sphere - spherule;*Grain - granule;*Node - noduleAlso of interest are some terms from biology.*An 'ovule' is an unfertilised or undeveloped seed (from Latin ovum), and*'sporule' is a small spore. It may seem strange for astronomy to borrow from such a source, but with talk of stars being 'born and 'dying' etc, maybe it is not so strange.How about Planetule to describe Pluto (?), Ceres et al.To the general public it would be easy to understand as meaning 'a very small or 'undeveloped' planet or planet like object'. It would square the circle of describing something that's like a planet, but doesn't make the grade to being a fully fledged one.As to how to distinguish a planetule from a planet, that's another day's work, but at least it would solve the 'Snow White' problem!","TIMESTAMP":"21:08, 17 November 2006 (UTC)","USER":"Neelmack"},{"COMMENT-ID":"7462583-52-1","COMMENT-NR":1,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":Wikipedia:No orginial research.","TIMESTAMP":"20:30, 11 January 2007 (UTC)","USER":"Michaelbusch"},{"COMMENT-ID":"7462583-52-2","COMMENT-NR":2,"LEVEL":1,"TEXT-CLEAN":":I find the proposal very interesting, but I have to agree here is the wrong place to discuss it.

I'll remove the offending paragraph.","TIMESTAMP":"01:34, 2 May 2008 (UTC)","USER":"RJC"},{"COMMENT-ID":"27847834-8-5","COMMENT-NR":5,"LEVEL":2,"TEXT-CLEAN":"::As you'll see from the length of my comments here, I find this matter very interesting; if you don't, feel free to ignore the following. 62.232.17.82 is quite right that in Socrates' days \"Athenians were highly conservative in religious matters.\" John Burnet says, \"\u2026the Athenians at the end of the fifth century B.C. were very orthodox, as is shown by such things as the prosecution of Anaxagoras, and the excitement caused by the mutilation of the Hermae, and the profanation of the Mysteries\" (p. 49, \"The Religious and Moral Ideas of Euripides\" in his Essays and Addresses). However, even about this we need to be careful, because apparently even rejection of the traditional Homeric tales about the gods (e.g.) was well within Greek \"orthodoxy\" at the time: \"As has often been remarked, the general trend of the best Greek thought on the problems of human conduct and destiny - as represented, e.g., by such poets as Aeschylus and Euripides - is in the direction of a vague monotheism\" (A.E. Taylor, \"Theism\" in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics). Burnet too says, \"\u2026it cannot be doubted that Plato personally believed in one God. Indeed, that was the belief of all intelligent Athenians at this date. \u2026 Greek literature, at least, is certainly polytheistic. \u2026 But we must bear in mind that such things [as we find in Homer] formed no part of Greek religion\u2026. It is certain that not only Plato but all intelligent Greeks regarded mythology as purely fanciful. The Greeks, we must remember, had no sacred books...\" (Platonism p. 118). Aside of this matter, however, 62.232.17.82 is mistaken in claiming that Socrates wasn't charged with atheism or wasn't believed to be an atheist. Also, though 62.232.17.82 may be right about Aristophanes, it may well be that Socrates was \"plainly\" an atheist (in the Greek sense) if he really believed some of the things Plato describes him as accepting. And, as I'll show, all this can be backed up by good sources, not \"original research\". But the matter is complicated by the fact that \"atheist\" in current English does not quite have the same meaning as the Greek term (atheos) from which our word came. First, some reasons that the Athenians might have had \u2013 or might have been presented with \u2013 to believe that Socrates was an atheist: As Aristophanes portrayed him in the Clouds, he accepted the views of the natural philosophers who notoriously rejected the personal gods of traditional ancient Greek religion. Of course, many of the Presocratics used religious terminology to describe natural phenomena: according to Aristotle (Physics 203b3-15), \"Anaximander and most of the natural philosophers\" said that the archai were \"divine\" because they were \"immortal and indestructible\". But their archai were impersonal \"divinities\". As Burnet notes, \"The use of the term ['god' or 'divine'] by the Milesians means rather that the place once occupied by the gods of religion was now being taken by the great fundamental phenomena of nature, and the later Greeks were quite right, from their own point of view, in calling that atheism\" (p. 201, \"Greek Philosophy\" in Essays and Addresses). Indeed, \"Hippo\u2026was nicknamed 'the Atheist' 'because he assigned the cause of everything to nothing else besides water' \" (Jonathan Barnes, quoting Diels-Kranz 38A8 in his The Prescratic Philosophers (2nd ed.), p. 96). Burnet says that the Athenians called Hippo an atheist because he believed that in death he would be equal to the gods, i.e. immortal (Burnet, \"Socrates\", Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics; Burnet here refers to the epitaph attributed to Hippo at Diels-Kranz 38B2, also quoted in Barnes op. cit.). Hippo is particularly interesting for us because, as Burnet notes, a medieval scholium attributes to Hippo one of the wacky views \u2013 that the heavens are like an oven - attributed to Socrates in the Clouds (line 96). All the more interesting for us is the fact that some scholars have attributed to Socrates Hippo's view about personal immortality; Burnet, e.g., claims that the Socrates of Plato's Apology accepted this kind of view (p. 257, \"The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul\", Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. 7); Gregory Vlastos says too says that for Socrates \"our soul is our self\" and \"[i]n the Crito [54b-c] he reveals his faith in the soul's survival\" (Socrates: Ironist and Moral Philosopher, p. 55). Burnet makes it clear that such a belief alone would be grounds for a charge of atheism: \"There was no room in the public religion [of Athens] for any doctrine of immortality. The gods alone are immortal, and it would be shocking to suggest that human beings might be so too. The dead are just the dead, and how can the dead be deathless? In the heroic age, indeed, some human beings had attained immortality by being turned into gods and heroes, but such things were not expected to happen now\" (p. 249, \"The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul\"). Even according to the Eleusinian and Orphic mystery cults the immorality of the soul did not mean that we ourselves survived death in any personally meaningful way; so Burnet explains that, even according to such a view, the soul \"may be divine and immortal, but it is really no concern of ours except in sleep and at the moment of death. It is not identified with what we call 'I' \" (ibid. p. 251). As for whether one of the charges against Socrates was \"atheism\", there is pretty substantial agreement among scholars. RJC was correct: As Thomas Brickhouse and Nicholas Smith put it, \"Meletus' charge [in Plato's Apology] is not that Socrates completely neglects proper religious practice; it is that Socrates is a complete atheist\" (p. 31, Socrates on Trial, ); they note \"it is clear that Xenophon also understood the charges against Socrates to involve atheism\" (ibid., citing Memorabilia 1.1.5). Burnet explains the charge somewhat differently: \"The charge against Socrates was, indeed, one of Atheism, but we see how remote the Greek meaning of this word was from ours by the fact that the indictment accused him of introducing 'new gods' \" (p. 52, \"The Religious and Moral Ideas of Euripides\"). Finally, Richard Janko: \"Whether or not Socrates had ever been one of these [natural] scientists, and whether or not he believed in the supernatural, as he clearly did, he was punished because many thought he was an 'atheist' (atheos) in the Greek sense\u2026. This broad term included people who believed in new gods, in one god, or in no god at all\" (p. 48, \"Socrates the Freethinker\" in Ahbel-Rappe and Kamtekar (eds.) A Companion to Socrates). And, as I tried to explain above, there is even some pretty good reason for thinking that Socrates was an atheist in this sense, if only because of his unorthodox belief that we survive bodily death in a personally meaningful way, i.e. that we \"mortals\" are really immortal and our souls divine.","TIMESTAMP":"04:12, 12 May 2008 (UTC)","USER":"Isokrates"},{"COMMENT-ID":"27847834-8-6","COMMENT-NR":6,"LEVEL":3,"TEXT-CLEAN":":::as far as I under stand it the official charge was impiety.

Same comment goes for the article on the \"War against the Bandits\", to which this article refers countless times: the views of the Cuban government are \"partisan\", the reaction of the cuban side was \"cruel\", their leaders always followed the \"tactics\" of others, the sources to that article are divided between \"Pro-cuban government\" and \"Others\". In this article, for example, people dead on the US side did not die, they \"lost their lives\". The British intelligence, reporting on popular support for the government, was not mistaken, they \"choose to ignore reports\". The number of cubans dead is ludicrous, most web references I find give a number in the hundreds, for example http:\/\/library.thinkquest.org\/18355\/the_bay_of_pigs_attack.html. The references are commented, for heavens sake, and many of them are pamphlets written by cuban exiles or obscure books without an ISBN. I fail to find a single reference to the Cuban government opinion on the issue. Apparently Cuba had no army at the time of the invasion: the forces that resisted are named in a thousand ways, but they're not the \"Cuban army\". The article repeat itself up to three times on the same issues, trying to avoid mentioning the merits that the cuban army could have had on the result of the operation. There are no references to the reject this \"operation\" created among other countries and the public demonstrations against the invasion in Europe or Latin America http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ce6\/history\/A0806555.html .
